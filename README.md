## Introduction
To allow organizations using enterprise business applications to determine an achievable, tailored-to approach defining actionable targets and measurable results, with the capability to scale by strengthening people, leveraging processes, and enhancing the use of tools. The Core Business Security Application (CBAS) project is designed to combine different industry standards and expertise from various security professionals to provide a comprehensive framework to align the measures for enterprise application security with the organization's security strategy. As a result, a framework is created to improve the security governance of the use of enterprise application technology.


## Background
Core business applications or enterprise business applications are beneficial to organizations in several ways. Some of these benefits include:

> - Combining different business processes under one solution
> - Improving business performance
> - Higher productivity by eliminating redundant processes
> - Flexibility and mobility
> - Easier collaboration between different organizational teams
> - Centralized data

With the numerous benefits these solutions have, security threats have not reduced. Maintaining, implementing, and deploying security controls and/or information security standards around such solutions is still facing challenges. Some of these challenges include:

> - Little to no understanding of the solutions in place
> - Security professionals not included in the initial phases of deploying and implementing such solutions
> - Security controls being built after the solution is operational and functional; causing a blow back from business units

## Objectives

While there are many enterprise solutions out there, SAP has been proven to dominate the ERP market. With that in mind, the initial CBAS project release focuses on SAP (CBAS-SAP).

The CBAS-SAP objectives and goals are defined in the [Objectives Matrix v1.0](Objective_Matrix.md)

## Contribution

The CBAS-SAP project is both an OWASP project and the initial project for our [Silverbacks Community](Website).
